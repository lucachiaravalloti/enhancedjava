# enhancedjava
This repository is to share my produced java library to obtain enhanced java application, particularly related to GUI interface.

Importing just 3 classes you can easily display tables with features that aren't readily available using basic Javax classes.

You can immediately have a table with:
1. Multiple column sort visualized with arrow icon and number of the column in the ordering sequence, obtained holding SHIFT key and clicking on the header;
2. Column fitted to its content when you click double-click on the header separation line;
3. One column showing progressive numbers to count the rows in the table;
4. All columns fitted to their content with one double-click on the prog column (see point 3.) if present;
5. Every column content can be aligned very easily to LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT.
6. Many other features will be added soon.

Here is a video about the above features:
