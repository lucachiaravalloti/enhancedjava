# enhancedjava
This repository is to share my produced java library to obtain enhanced java application, particularly related to GUI interface.

You find classes to easily visualize table with facilities that doesn't come immediately using basic javax classes.

You can immediately have a table with:
1. Multiple column sort visualized with arrow icon and number of the column in the ordering sequence, obtained holding SHIFT key and clicking on the header;
2. Column fitted to its content when you click double-click on the header separation line;
3. One column showing progressive numbers to count the rows in the table;
4. All columns fitted to their content with one double-click on the prog column (see point 3.) if present;
5. String and Enum columns can be RIGHT/CENTER/LEFT aligned very easily;
6. Many other features will be added soon.
